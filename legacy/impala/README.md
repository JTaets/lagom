# Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures (IMPALA)

This is an implementation of [IMPALA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01561) algorithm. 

# Usage

Run the following command to start parallelized training:

```bash
python experiment.py
```

One could modify [experiment.py](./experiment.py) to quickly set up different configurations.
